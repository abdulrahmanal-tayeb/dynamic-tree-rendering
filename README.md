### Dynamic Tree Modeling
#### By Abdulrahman M. Al-Tayeb with `tree-model` Library

This is a React-Django application, so you should know how to run a Django server. You can run and render the sample graph directly from the React application.

**NOTE:** You need to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file for Django to work properly.

Type: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install the necessary packages, including `django-rest-framework` and `django-cors-headers`.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Django server and the React development server. From the project root directory, run the following command: `python manage.py runserver`

And the react server: `npm start`
This will start the React development server and open the application in your default browser.

The `tree-model` library is used to create and manage the dynamic tree structure in this application. You can find more information about the library and its usage in the [official documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tree-model).
